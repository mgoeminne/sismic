Graphical User Interface
========================

Statechart execution UI
-----------------------

Sismic comes with a graphical user interface that can be used to load and execute a statechart.
If you installed Sismic using pip, this GUI should be available on the command line using the
``sismic-execute`` command. On Windows, an executable ``sismic-execute.exe`` should be available.

If this is not the case, or if you installed Sismic from its repository, the graphical user
interface can be manually launched using ``python -m sismic.ui.execute``.
